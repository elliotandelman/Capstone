<h1>Anti-Tree Foundation</h1>

<h5>Mission Statement:</h5>
<p>We will get rid of all trees, so we can see mount everest from San Francisco. The only thing in the way from here to Mount Everest is the trees.
    How cool would it be to look out your window and see the "Mountain of Doom". These people says trees help the planet, but it doesn't matter if I don't have a view
